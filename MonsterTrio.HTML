<h2> Luffy Zoro Sanji </h2>
<p>By GHchomp<br>
A name given to the three most strongest members of the Straw Hat Pirates by the crew themselves.<br>
The group consists of Monkey D. Luffy, Roronoa Zoro and Sanji.<br>
These three are monsters on the battle feild although it rare they have to work together when<br>
 they do it not only a spectacle is also horrifying the name Monster Trio is an understatement for these legends.<br>
 As such in the Alliance the three are regarded as among the strongest in their respected Divisions/Fleets.<br>
The chemistry between these three is quite unique while theyâ€™re friends and on the same crew Sanji<br>
sometimes chews out Luffy or Zoro mainly because he hates Zoro but tolerates Luffy the best example is a love<br>
hate relationship but it all changes on the battle field.<br>
Well Thats All For Now.BTW Kaustav you were my best freind forever.</p>
